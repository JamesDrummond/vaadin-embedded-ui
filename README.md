# Example of Vaadin's Embedded UI Addon

Microservices are recreating what it is to be truly Agile. The larger a monolithic program is the harder it will be to be Agile. While most that use microservices know that business logic should be split into microservices, there seems to be a lack of interest in creating microservices for the front end UI. It's not just a matter of getting updates out quicker but also allowing modularity of code and easier understanding of pieces of the UI without having to understand the whole.

This example code uses Vaadin's embedded UI addon and Nginx front end. The code is intended to be run as a set of containers via docker compose. A factory will be used to get users using Eclipse Che or Codenvy up and running very quickly.
